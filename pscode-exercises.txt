// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

// Read input from the user
Read num1
Read num2

// Calculate the sum of two numbers
sum = num1 + num2

// Print the sum
Print sum


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

// Read input
Read num

// Check if number is even or odd
if num % 2 == 0 then
    Print "Even"
else
    Print "Odd"

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

// Initialize variables
total = 0
smallest = infinity
largest = -infinity

// Read in 5 separate numbers
for i = 1 to 5:
    Read num
    total = total + num
    
    // Check for smallest number
    if num < smallest:
        smallest = num
    
    // Check for largest number
    if num > largest:
        largest = num

// Calculate the average
average = total / 5

// Display the results
Display "The average of the five numbers is", average
Display "The smallest number is", smallest
Display "The largest number is", largest
